# Haptic Bits Lab Repository
here you find all the necessary files to be able to eithe build your own or repair a Haptic Bit. If you want to know more what a haptic bit is or the Haptic Bits Lab, have a look here: (https://hbits.forsslundsystems.com)

## Firmware
The bits are driven by an ESP32. If you would like to make changes to the firmware you are free to download this repository and open it in VS code with the platform.io plugin.

This can be usefull if for example you wish to customise the haptic patterns for the vibration bits.

# Do it Yourself
The Haptic Bits Lab is designed to be built by anyone that has access to a 3D printer and laser cutter. The bill of materials is in [foldername]. The carrier PCB are produced by PCBway and can be order semi-populated with SMD parts via this link: (https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Haptic_Bits_Lab_Carrier_PCB_semi_populated_7a38576c.html)

The 3D model of the enclosure are modelled in Fusion 360 and can be downloaded here:
